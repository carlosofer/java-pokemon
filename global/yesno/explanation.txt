YesNo procedures

This package is for all Yes/No dialog procedures in the game, since I can't implement them as a simple method. In here, you'll find all the code for each of the different choices in YesNo.

The YesNo thing can only change variables. You can only use YesNo to make the player walk after the text is finished.
