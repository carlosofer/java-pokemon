Save File Layout

The savefile is a binary file. I don't want to save it as text because I want to try and actually save it using binary formats. Also, it makes ripping harder. ^_^

1.1 Trainer's name

Self-explanatory, a 10-byte string containing the trainer's name.

1.2 Trainer's money

A 4-byte string containing the trainer's amount of money. Read in big-endian order. The trainer can have up to about 21 million dollars worth of cash. (2,147,483,647 pyen).

1.4 Trainer's badges

1.4.1 Elite Four and Champions

Another byte that contains data on whether the trainer has defeated the Elite Four and Champion of each respective region or not.

1.5 Trainer's backpack

This will be about 600 bytes total.

1.5.1 Medicine
	A 26-byte string, allowing each item to have up to 65,535 of its count. Counted in this category are: Potion, Super Potion, Ultra Potion, Max Potion, Antidote, Parlyz Heal, Awakening, Burn Heal, Ice Heal, Full Heal, Full Restore.
1.5.2 Key Items
	A 5-byte string. Each Key Item can only have one occurrence, so there will be at most 40 key items.
1.5.2.1 Coin Case Coins
	A 2-byte string that comes strictly after the Key Item string. The coin case can store up to 9999 coins.
1.5.3 Pokeballs

		* Later, include balls from other generations, but for now...yeah.
1.5.4 TM's and HM's
	A 200-byte string that allows each TM and/or HM to have up to 255 of its count. (There will be about 200 TM's. XD)
1.5.5 Berries
	An 86-byte string that allows each berry to have up to 65,535 of its count. (43 berries in total, correct?)
1.5.6 Other Items
	A 300-byte string containing Any items that don't go in the other pockets. Up to 150 items go here, with up to 65,535 of each item. Item slots cannot be duplicated. In-battle items and mail are lumped into this category.

1.6 Trainer's party

A 6x80 byte string containing the trainer's party status.

byte   0 -   1: species
byte   2 -  11: nickname
byte  12 -  15: OT_ID (16 to 23 are replaced.)
byte  24 -  27: personality value

1.7 Pokedex

A 493-byte string containing the trainer's Pokedex status. Each byte is set to 0 if the Pokemon was not met, 1 if the Pokemon was met, and 2 if the Pokemon was caught.

1.8 Misc Data

The total size so far is a measly 1,575 bytes. I'll leave this at 2,048 just to be safe.

2.1 Unlocks

An 60-byte string containing whether certain things were unlocked or not.

2.2 PC Data

2.2.1 Pokemon

There are a total of 20 boxes, each of which can hold 30 Pokemon, for a total of 600 x 80 bytes, + another 160 for the names of all 20 boxes.

// A consequence of having 80 bytes is that all the status conditions, etc. of Pokemon are retained when they are sent to the PC.

2.2.2 Items

Only miscellaneous items can be stored in the PC. As usual, there are 150 spaces for them, and each can hold up to 65,535.

2.3 NPC Trainer Data

About 600 to 700 bytes are allocated to this, depending on how many trainers I decide to program in. Depending on the data here, each trainer will have different Pokemon, different reactions, etc.

-1 = Unmet and eager
0 = Unmet
1 = Met and currently unwilling.
2 = Met, but willing again.
3 or more (n) = Met n-1 times, but willing again. Different n's will have different things. Maximum is probably 100. Once a trainer has been met 100 times, it ceases to keep levelling up.

2.4 Misc Data

This contains a 1-byte variable for the step counter. This step counter controls happiness, egg cycles, etc. It also contains an 8-byte string representing at which position the player is.

3.1 Checksum

There is a 16-byte checksum at the end. The method with which it should be computed will come later.
